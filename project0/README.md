# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello everyone..! Here is my project0 where I have build a webpage using all the tools I have learn't so far. My project0 consists of seven .html files and each html file has its own styling. For some files I have included different .css  file whereas some html files include styling in itself. I have also used bootstrap for some of the html files and also used sass properties.

This webpage is mainly done for my understanding purpose. I have tried to include all the features and tools that are learn't until now as per the requirements given in the project description. Take a look on my webpage.
