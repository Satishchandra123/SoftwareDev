                    <h2>Home Page</h2>
                <p>Hello Everyone! This Webpage is created for my understanding and practice purpose. I have used different html commands and CSS properties in order to develop this webpage. I have also included bootstrap and Sass properties in order to complete this webpage. As I have created this web page I would like to include different aspects of my educational life and personal views in this web page. </p>
                <p>The Navigation tab on the left side allows you to refer different aspects that I have included on this webpage. Once you click on the particular topic in the navigation menu you will be directed to the other webpage where the information about it is included. I have used reference links in order to achieve this feature.</p>
                <p>Different concepts that I have used in developing this webpage are stated below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML commands</li>
                    <li>CSS for styling the webpage</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap</li>
                    <li>Sass</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Developing this webpage enabled me to understand the concepts in detail and it helped me to get hands on experience in using different commands and properties.Usage of this HTML and CSS properties is one of the important aspects in front-end.</p>
